Joda-Beans-UI
-------------

A user interface generator for Joda-Beans.

Joda-Beans provides a small framework that adds properties to Java, greatly enhancing JavaBeans.
This UI project uses the meta-data available in Joda-Beans to create a user interface.

While the user interface created by this project will never match a hand-coded UI, it will suffice
for many scenarios. The key advantage is that it is quick to create a usable UI.
